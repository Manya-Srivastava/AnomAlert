Here’s a full overview of all the features you’ve integrated into your real-time predictive maintenance dashboard project, along with how they demonstrate your tech skills and real-world problem-solving:

🚀 Project Title: Real-Time Predictive Maintenance & Failure Detection Dashboard

🛠️ Tech Stack:

* Language: Python
* Libraries: Streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib/seaborn, time
* Models: Random Forest Classifier (Failure Prediction), Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
* Tools/Concepts: Streamlit for frontend, ML model persistence, CSV data upload, real-time simulation, user interaction

📦 Key Features You’ve Implemented:

1. ✅ Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

* Uses a trained Random Forest model to predict equipment/component failure.
* Takes input from live user entries or uploaded historical data.
* Shows failure probability & label (“Yes” / “No”).

2. 🔍 Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

* Detects unusual patterns in sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, gas\_ppm).
* Displays result as “Normal” or “Anomaly Detected 🚨”.
* Helps flag issues before failure occurs.

3. 📊 Historical Data Upload & Visualization

* User can upload CSV file of machine sensor logs.
* Graphs of sensor values over time are auto-generated (line chart).
* Visual pattern recognition supported.

4. 🧠 On-the-Fly Model Retraining (Very Advanced)

* Upload labeled CSV with new sensor & failure data.
* Automatically retrains and saves updated model (Random Forest).
* Helps adapt the system to changing hardware/conditions.

5. 🛠️ Multi-Machine Support (Optional)

* Filters uploaded data by machine\_id column.
* Allows analysis per individual machine.
* Real-world production-grade feature for manufacturing plants.

6. 📥 Alert Log Download

* Logs anomalies and failures into an alert history list.
* Can be exported as downloadable CSV report.
* Helps generate audit reports or share with operations teams.

7. ⏱️ Real-Time Simulation

* Streams uploaded historical data row-by-row.
* Displays timestamped prediction & anomaly info live.
* Simulates real-world IoT streaming system without needing hardware.

💼 Why This Project Will Impress Recruiters:

* ✅ It combines real-world predictive maintenance use case with solid machine learning.
* ✅ Demonstrates your ability to build end-to-end apps: frontend + backend + model.
* ✅ Shows understanding of concepts like anomaly detection, sensor analytics, retraining, and alerting.
* ✅ Modular design; scalable to cloud or edge deployment.
* ✅ Strong proof of your practical data science, ML, and full-stack skills.

📍 Real-World Applications:

* Predictive maintenance in manufacturing, IoT, EV batteries, HVAC systems
* Reduces downtime, saves money, prevents accidents

⏳ Time to Complete (based on experience):

* 5–8 days for intermediate level (with full features)
* 2–3 days if you already have the base model and focus on frontend only

Would you like me to package this as a portfolio-ready README + GitHub structure with instructions? I can also help you:

* Add performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
* Prepare a short demo video script
* Add deployment (Streamlit Cloud or Docker or Heroku)


📥 Sensor Input Parameters:
Parameter	Description
🌡️ Temperature (°C)	Measures the heat level of the machine; abnormal rise may indicate overheating.
📳 Vibration (mm/s)	Measures mechanical vibrations; high values can signal mechanical faults.
⚙️ Pressure (bar)	Measures internal pressure in systems like boilers or pipes.
🧪 Gas Concentration (ppm)	Indicates the amount of gas leaked/emitted, important for safety in chemical plants.
